# deep learning is a part of human learning and based on neural network
# a neural netwirk is aseries of neurons which is inconnected and having some weight to build any detection for output or trained


# the structure of neural network
# keypoints
# neurons - User input
# weight - parameter to reduce the error
# activation function
# forward propagation
# backword propagaton
# error of function / loose function
# type neural network, FNN, CNN, Transformers, GenAI
# applicatoion of genai
# image generation
# text generation
# language translation
